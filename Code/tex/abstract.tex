\section{Abstract}
%It is generally acknowledged that the total luminosity of a galaxy in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum and its emission
% lines are directly proportional to that galaxy's star formation rate (SFR). Forero-Romero and Dijkstra $\left[1\right]$ have found
% in theoretical studies that under special conditions certain stochastic processes can break this proportionality. In the following
% work, we will be applying the \texttt{PyFits} library as well as \texttt{PIPE3D}, the analysis pipeline proposed by S\'anchez et.al.
% $\left[2\right]$ in order to analyze data from both data releases of the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy (CALIFA)
% survey $\left[3, 4\right]$. Finally, the results obtained can be used to contrast observational data with the theoretical model
% applied by Forero-Romero and Dijkstra in $\left[1\right]$.
